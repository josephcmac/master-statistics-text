abstract = {The FDA Center for Veterinary Medicine (CVM) (Bartholomew et al., 2005) recently proposed an approach to risk management based on the linear modeling framework: Risk = K × Exposure. They suggest that, once K has been estimated from historical data, it can be used to predict how limiting future exposure will reduce future risk. They illustrate the approach for fluoroquinolone-resistant campylobacter in chicken. However, despite its appealing simplicity, the proposed approach confuses a possibly meaningless descriptive statistical ratio with a valid predictive causal relation. In general, the historical ratio K = (Risk/Exposure) may not predict how changing future exposures will affect future risks, and hence it does not necessarily provide an appropriate guide to current risk management actions. We identify several limitations of the proposed framework, including omission of frequency and severity of human health harm in quantifying “Risk” and omission of microbial load from “Exposure.” Finally, we show that an extended linear modeling approach that considers impacts of changing animal antibiotic use on susceptible as well as on resistant bacteria is consistent with the conclusion that reducing “Exposure” can greatly increase “Risk.”},

    abstract = {Measurement error in explanatory variables and unmeasured confounders can cause considerable problems in epidemiologic studies. It is well recognized that under certain conditions, nondifferential measurement error in the exposure variable produces bias towards the null. Measurement error in confounders will lead to residual confounding, but this is not a straightforward issue, and it is not clear in which direction the bias will point. Unmeasured confounders further complicate matters. There has been discussion about the amount of bias in exposure effect estimates that can plausibly occur due to residual or unmeasured confounding. In this paper, the authors use simulation studies and logistic regression analyses to investigate the size of the apparent exposure-outcome association that can occur when in truth the exposure has no causal effect on the outcome. The authors consider two cases with a normally distributed exposure and either two or four normally distributed confounders. When the confounders are uncorrelated, bias in the exposure effect estimate increases as the amount of residual and unmeasured confounding increases. Patterns are more complex for correlated confounders. With plausible assumptions, effect sizes of the magnitude frequently reported in observational epidemiologic studies can be generated by residual and/or unmeasured confounding alone.},

Critics of these attempts point out that ecologic effect estimates are inevitably used as estimates of individual effects, despite disclaimers. A more subtle problem is that ecologic variation in the distribution of individual effects can bias ecologic estimates of contextual effects. The conditions leading to this bias are plausible and perhaps even common in studies of ecosocial factors and health outcomes because social context is not randomized across typical analysis units (administrative regions). By definition, ecologic data contain only marginal observations on the joint distribution of individually defined confounders and outcomes, and so identify neither contextual nor individual-level effects. While ecologic studies can still be useful given appropriate caveats, their problems are better addressed by multilevel study designs, which obtain and use individual as well as group-level data. Nonetheless, such studies often share certain special problems with ecologic studies, including problems due to inappropriate aggregation and problems due to temporal changes in covariate distributions.},

Using extensive national data on mortality, air quality and socio-economic status regression analyses are used to study the influence of air quality on mortality. The analytic methods and data are selected in such a way that direct comparisons can be made with other ecologic regression studies of mortality and air quality. Analyses are performed by use of two types of geographic areas, age-specific mortality of both males and females and three pollutants (total suspended particulates, sulfur dioxide and nitrogen dioxide). The overall results indicate no persuasive evidence exists of a link between air quality and general mortality levels. Additionally, a lack of consistency between the present results and previous published work is noted. Overall, it is concluded that linear regression analysis applied to nationally collected ecologic data cannot be used to usefully infer a causal relationship between air quality and mortality which is in direct contradiction to other major published studies.}

This finding is robust with respect to the inclusion of multiple fixed and time-varying controls. The mortality increases are driven by elevated levels of respiratory diseases, providing suggestive evidence of an air pollution mechanism.},

abstract = {Human health risk assessment can be used to support decisions for public health regulations and actions. Characterizing the hazards of inhaled toxicants generally includes extrapolation from observations on experimental animals, subjected to intermittent or subchronic exposures, to a human environmental context with exposure that is usually continuous and long-term. The extrapolation is usually based on a simple linear relationship derived from Haber's rule which assumes that, for a given chemical compound, multiplying the same concentration by the same duration of exposure will yield the same biological response. This study assessed the reliability of this assumption. The p-power in the equation C×tp=k was calculated for 21 chemicals, based on a comparison of LOAELs for subacute, subchronic and chronic durations. A bibliographic survey was then carried out to study the reliability of the intermittent-to-continuous exposure adjustment factors currently used in risk assessment. The results showed that the value of p, assumed to be 1 in risk assessment methodology, was not in fact equal to 1 for any of the selected chemicals. Moreover, in the case of respiratory tract irritation, the value of p varied from 0 to 0.44, as confirmed by experimental studies. These results suggest that a more in-depth and case-by-case approach is required for regulatory toxicology, based on toxicokinetics and toxicodynamic data analysis for each toxicant before applying a temporal-adjustment factor.}

This equivalent dose metric (EDM) hypothesis allows risks to be extrapolated from high concentrations to low concentrations and from one species, sex, and strain to another, since it implies that all administered dose histories corresponding to the same total dose create the same risk. This paper tests the EDM hypothesis using data on tumor rates in B6C3F1 mice administered isoprene via inhalation. Its major conclusion is that the EDM hypothesis does not hold for isoprene. For example, it appears that exposure concentration has a greater impact on tumor rates than weeks of exposure. To predict tumor probabilities, the time pattern of dose administration must be considered. The asymmetric effects of concentration, hours-per-day, and number of days of exposure on tumor risks imply that complex dynamic risk models may be needed to accurately describe dose-time-response relations. The traditional concept of a dose-response relation as a static curve relating a numerical summary of dose to a numerical summary of response probability is probably not predictively useful for chemicals such as isoprene, and extrapolations of risk based on the EDM hypothesis could be misleading for such chemicals.}

abstract = { Chronic inflammation mediates an extraordinarily wide range of diseases. Recent progress in understanding intracellular inflammasome assembly, priming, activation, cytokine signaling, and interactions with mitochondrial reactive oxygen species, lysosome disruption, cell death, and prion-like polymerization and spread of inflammasomes among cells, has potentially profound implications for dose–response modeling. This article discusses mechanisms of exposure concentration and duration thresholds for NOD-like receptor protein 3 (NLRP3)-mediated inflammatory responses and develops a simple biomathematical model of the onset of exposure-related tissue-level chronic inflammation and resulting disease risks, focusing on respirable crystalline silica (RCS) and lung cancer risk as an example. An inflammation-mediated 2-stage clonal expansion model of RCS-induced lung cancer is proposed that explains why relatively low estimated concentrations of RCS (eg, <1 mg/m3) do not increase lung cancer risk and why even high occupational concentrations increase risk only modestly (typically relative risk <2). The model of chronic inflammation implies a dose–response threshold for excess cancer risk, in contrast to traditional linear-no-threshold assumptions. If this implication is correct, then concentrations of crystalline silica (or amphibole asbestos fibers, or other environmental challenges that act via the NLRP3 inflammasome) below the threshold do not cause chronic inflammation and resulting elevated risks of inflammation-mediated diseases.}

abstract = {An underlying basis of risk assessment is that an equivalent risk for a specified dose metric exists that allows for extrapolation of dose–response relationships between species. To better understand the use of area under the curve (AUC) as a dose metric for complex biological responses following 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) exposure, a study was designed using a physiologically based pharmacokinetic model in the female Sprague–Dawley rat that would result in equivalent AUCs of total liver TCDD with differing patterns of exposure. In the first group, rats received a high peak dose of 3500 ng TCDD/kg twice per week in the first week followed by a lower TCDD dose of 81 ng/kg twice per week for the remainder of the study. In the second group, rats received a gavage dose of 350 ng TCDD/kg in corn oil twice per week for the study duration of 15 weeks. Age-matched control rats received corn oil as a vehicle control. Placental glutathione S-transferase (PGST)-positive foci were measured in representative liver lobes by immunohistochemistry, as a representative complex biological response resulting from TCDD exposure. The median volume fraction was 0.045% in control rats and was significantly elevated in TCDD treatment groups. However, the volume fraction of PGST-positive foci was significantly higher in the TCDD group given the high peak dose during the first week of TCDD treatment compared with the group receiving the same average daily dose over the study duration: 0.74 versus 0.20%, respectively. These findings suggest that the peak magnitude of TCDD in liver rather than AUC may play a significant role in the induction of complex biological responses by TCDD.}

This mantra, chanted by scientists for more than a century, has led to a virtual prohibition on causal talk. Today, that taboo is dead. The causal revolution, instigated by Judea Pearl and his colleagues, has cut through a century of confusion and established causality--the study of cause and effect--on a firm scientific basis. His work explains how we can know easy things, like whether it was rain or a sprinkler that made a sidewalk wet; and how to answer hard questions, like whether a drug cured an illness. Pearl's work enables us to know not just whether one thing causes another: it lets us explore the world that is and the worlds that could have been. It shows us the essence of human thought and key to artificial intelligence. Anyone who wants to understand either needs The Book of Why.}

Case-control studies that use friend controls and the practice of age-matching controls to cases within a specified number of years (caliper matching) are examples of the selection bias described in the paper. The bias resulting from the use of friend controls can be large and, since the use of friend controls is common, this source of bias is of considerable practical consequence. The use of friend controls or the selection of controls according to ther variables with categories that overlap should be avoided.},

 abstract = {The case-crossover study design is used to study the triggers of acute outcomes in populations. It controls for all measured and unmeasured time-invariant confounders by design. Studies of environmental triggers of morbidity are potentially confounded by temporal trends in the outcome owing to omitted covariates. We conducted a simulation study of the case-crossover design's ability to control for temporal confounding patterns by design rather than through modeling. We compared five case-crossover control sampling strategies including the matched pair, a symmetric bi-directional, a total history approach, and two approaches proposed by Navidi (Biometrics 1998; 54:596-605). We simulated true relative risks (RR) of 1.10 and 2.00 and induced confounding by seasonal patterns as well as linear and nonlinear long-term trends to yield estimated RR values as high as 3.18. The symmetric bi-directional approach was compared across four lag times and controlled for temporal confounding best when the lag was shortest. With a 1-week lag, it estimated the RR values as 1.10 and 2.01. The four other approaches failed to control for the temporal trends. Our simulations show that the symmetric bi-directional case-crossover design can substantially control for temporal confounding by design although it is not as efficient (66%) as Poisson regression analysis.},

increased rates of hospital admissions and exacerbation of respiratory illnesses.
Although numerous time-series studies have estimated associations between
day-to-day variation in ozone levels and mortality counts, results have been
inconclusive.ObjectiveTo investigate whether short-term (daily and weekly) exposure to ambient
ozone is associated with mortality in the United States.Design and SettingUsing analytical methods and databases developed for the National Morbidity,
Mortality, and Air Pollution Study, we estimated a national average relative
rate of mortality associated with short-term exposure to ambient ozone for
95 large US urban communities from 1987-2000. We used distributed-lag models
for estimating community-specific relative rates of mortality adjusted for
time-varying confounders (particulate matter, weather, seasonality, and long-term
trends) and hierarchical models for combining relative rates across communities
to estimate a national average relative rate, taking into account spatial
heterogeneity.Main Outcome MeasureDaily counts of total non–injury-related mortality and cardiovascular
and respiratory mortality in 95 large US communities during a 14-year period.ResultsA 10-ppb increase in the previous week’s ozone was associated
with a 0.52\% increase in daily mortality (95\% posterior interval [PI], 0.27\%-0.77\%)
and a 0.64\% increase in cardiovascular and respiratory mortality (95\% PI,
0.31\%-0.98\%). Effect estimates for aggregate ozone during the previous week
were larger than for models considering only a single day’s exposure.
Results were robust to adjustment for particulate matter, weather, seasonality,
and long-term trends.ConclusionsThese results indicate a statistically significant association between
short-term changes in ozone and mortality on average for 95 large US urban
communities, which include about 40\% of the total US population. The findings
indicate that this widespread pollutant adversely affects public health.},

The authors present an example of accountability assessment based on evaluating change in the short-term effect of airborne particles over a period of increasingly stringent regulation that might have changed the chemical composition and toxicity of these particles. They used updated data and methods of the National Morbidity Mortality Air Pollution Study to estimate national average relative rates of the effects of particulate matter ≤10 μm in aerodynamic diameter on all-cause, cardiovascular, and respiratory mortality and on other-cause mortality for 1987–2000. They estimated national average relative rates of the effects of particulate matter ≤2.5 μm in aerodynamic diameter on all-cause mortality for 1999–2000. The authors found strong evidence that lag 1 exposures to particulate matter ≤10 μm and ≤2.5 μm in aerodynamic diameter continue to be associated with increased mortality. They also found a weak indication that the lag 1 effects of particulate matter ≤10 μm in aerodynamic diameter on mortality declined during 1987–2000 and that this decline occurred mostly in the eastern United States. The methodology presented can be used to track the health effects of air pollution routinely on regional and national scales.},

    abstract = {Reports over the last decade of association between levels of particles in outdoor air and daily mortality counts have raised concern that air pollution shortens life, even at concentrations within current regulatory limits. Criticisms of these reports have focused on the statistical techniques that are used to estimate the pollution–mortality relationship and the inconsistency in findings between cities. We have developed analytical methods that address these concerns and combine evidence from multiple locations to gain a unified analysis of the data. The paper presents log-linear regression analyses of daily time series data from the largest 20 US cities and introduces hierarchical regression models for combining estimates of the pollution–mortality relationship across cities. We illustrate this method by focusing on mortality effects of PM10 (particulate matter less than 10 μm in aerodynamic diameter) and by performing univariate and bivariate analyses with PM10 and ozone (O3) level. In the first stage of the hierarchical model, we estimate the relative mortality rate associated with PM10 for each of the 20 cities by using semiparametric log-linear models. The second stage of the model describes between-city variation in the true relative rates as a function of selected city-specific covariates. We also fit two variations of a spatial model with the goal of exploring the spatial correlation of the pollutant-specific coefficients among cities. Finally, to explore the results of considering the two pollutants jointly, we fit and compare univariate and bivariate models. All posterior distributions from the second stage are estimated by using Markov chain Monte Carlo techniques. In univariate analyses using concurrent day pollution values to predict mortality, we find that an increase of 10 μg m-3 in PM10 on average in the USA is associated with a 0.48\% increase in mortality (95\% interval: 0.05, 0.92). With adjustment for the O3 level the PM10-coefficient is slightly higher. The results are largely insensitive to the specific choice of vague but proper prior distribution. The models and estimation methods are general and can be used for any number of locations and pollutant measurements and have potential applications to other environmental agents.},

abstract = {Abstract The case-crossover design uses cases only, and compares exposures just prior to the event times to exposures at comparable control, or ‘referent’ times, in order to assess the effect of short-term exposure on the risk of a rare event. It has commonly been used to study the effect of air pollution on the risk of various adverse health events. Proper selection of referents is crucial, especially with air pollution exposures, which are shared, highly seasonal, and often have a long-term time trend. Hence, careful referent selection is important to control for time-varying confounders, and in order to ensure that the distribution of exposure is constant across referent times, a key assumption of this method. Yet the referent strategy is important for a more basic reason: the conditional logistic regression estimating equations commonly used are biased when referents are not chosen a priori and are functions of the observed event times. We call this bias in the estimating equations overlap bias. In this paper, we propose a new taxonomy of referent selection strategies in order to emphasize their statistical properties. We give a derivation of overlap bias, explore its magnitude, and consider how the bias depends on properties of the exposure series. We conclude that the bias is usually small, though highly unpredictable, and easily avoided. Copyright © 2004 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

We argue that much thinking about this design has been based on false analogies with matched case – control studies, and show that the usual design and analysis of case – crossover studies introduce a previously unrecognized bias by not conditioning correctly on the sampling scheme. We show that the usual conditional logistic regression analysis is a valid maximum likelihood method for a simple modification of the case – crossover design that divides time into strata. However, the bias from standard case – crossover designs will typically be small. Copyright © 2000 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

Respiratory hospital admissions and air pollution data were obtained for 1986–1999. In a meta-analysis based on the city-specific regression models, several city characteristics were evaluated as effect modifiers. During the warm season, the 2-day cumulative effect of a 5-ppb increase in ozone was a 0.27\% (95\% confidence interval (CI): 0.08, 0.47) increase in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease admissions and a 0.41\% (95\% CI: 0.26, 0.57) increase in pneumonia admissions. Similarly, a 10-μg/m3 increase in PM10 during the warm season resulted in a 1.47\% (95\% CI: 0.93, 2.01) increase in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease at lag 1 and a 0.84\% (95\% CI: 0.50, 1.19) increase in pneumonia at lag 0. Percentage of households with central air conditioning reduced the effect of air pollution, and variability of summer apparent temperature reduced the effect of ozone on chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. The study confirmed, in a large sample of cities, that exposure to ozone and PM10 is associated with respiratory hospital admissions and provided evidence that the effect of air pollution is modified by certain city characteristics.},

While the design provides considerable advantages, unidirectional retrospective control sampling (selecting control times only prior to failure) can cause risk estimates to be confounded by time trends in exposure. However, when subsequent exposures are not influenced by failures, as in studies of environmental exposures such as air pollutants, it is possible to determine at times postfailure what a subject's level of exposure would have been had the subject not failed. We describe a bidirectional case-crossover design in which exposures at failure are compared with exposures both before and after failure. Simulation analyses show that relative risk estimates are resistant to confounding by time trend. We also extend the method to studies involving multiple failure times.},

A Poisson regression analysis using the same model found that a 100-microg/m(3) increment in the 48-hr mean concentration of total suspended particulates (TSP) was associated with increased all-cause mortality [rate ratio = 1.069; 95\% confidence interval (CI), 1.043-1.096) after adjustment for quadratic trend, season, year, previous day's mean temperature, dew point, winter temperature, and indicators of hot (temperature \&gt; 80 degrees F) and humid days (dew point \&gt; 66 degrees F). Critics suggested that time-varying factors such as season and day of week were not sufficiently controlled in this analysis and subsequent studies in other locations. We used a conditional logistic regression analysis with a case-crossover design to reanalyze the data, with air pollution in the prior and subsequent weeks to the day of death serving as referent periods. The case-crossover approach controls for season and day of week by design rather than modeling. We found that a 100-microg/m(3) increment in the 48-hr mean level of TSP was associated with increased all-cause mortality [odds ratio (OR) = 1.056; CI, 1.027-1.086) after adjustment for the same weather variables as above. Similar associations were observed for deaths in individuals over 65 years of age (OR = 1.074; CI, 1. 037-1.111) and for deaths due to cardiovascular disease (OR = 1.063; CI, 1.021-1.107). The current case-crossover analysis confirms the general conclusion of the previous Poisson regression analysis of an association of TSP with daily mortality in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. }

    abstract = {Time series models relating short-term changes in air pollution levels to daily mortality counts typically assume that the effects of air pollution on the log relative rate of mortality do not vary with time. However, these short-term effects might plausibly vary by season. Changes in the sources of air pollution and meteorology can result in changes in characteristics of the air pollution mixture across seasons. The authors developed Bayesian semiparametric hierarchical models for estimating time-varying effects of pollution on mortality in multisite time series studies. The methods were applied to the database of the National Morbidity and Mortality Air Pollution Study, which includes data for 100 US cities, for the period 1987–2000. At the national level, a 10-μg/m3 increase in particulate matter less than 10 μm in aerodynamic diameter at a 1-day lag was associated with 0.15\% (95\% posterior interval (PI): −0.08, 0.39), 0.14\% (95\% PI: −0.14, 0.42), 0.36\% (95\% PI: 0.11, 0.61), and 0.14\% (95\% PI: −0.06, 0.34) increases in mortality for winter, spring, summer, and fall, respectively. An analysis by geographic region found a strong seasonal pattern in the Northeast (with a peak in summer) and little seasonal variation in the southern regions of the country. These results provide useful information for understanding particle toxicity and guiding future analyses of particle constituent data.},

abstract = {Background—Elevated concentrations of ambient particulate air pollution have been associated with increased hospital admissions for cardiovascular disease. Whether high concentrations of ambient particles can trigger the onset of acute myocardial infarction (MI), however, remains unknown. Methods and Results—We interviewed 772 patients with MI in the greater Boston area between January 1995 and May 1996 as part of the Determinants of Myocardial Infarction Onset Study. Hourly concentrations of particle mass \&lt;2.5 μm (PM2.5), carbon black, and gaseous air pollutants were measured. A case-crossover approach was used to analyze the data for evidence of triggering. The risk of MI onset increased in association with elevated concentrations of fine particles in the previous 2-hour period. In addition, a delayed response associated with 24-hour average exposure 1 day before the onset of symptoms was observed. Multivariate analyses considering both time windows jointly revealed an estimated odds ratio of 1.48 associated with an increase of 25 μg/m3 PM2.5 during a 2-hour period before the onset and an odds ratio of 1.69 for an increase of 20 μg/m3 PM2.5 in the 24-hour period 1 day before the onset (95\% CIs 1.09, 2.02 and 1.13, 2.34, respectively). Conclusions—The present study suggests that elevated concentrations of fine particles in the air may transiently elevate the risk of MIs within a few hours and 1 day after exposure. Further studies in other locations are needed to clarify the importance of this potentially preventable trigger of MI.}}

Myocardial infarction is one of the main causes of death from cardiovascular disease. A myocardial infarction has a sudden onset, and factors related to lifestyle have been identified as potential triggers of myocardial infarction. These include strenuous exercise,1–3 anger,4 and the use of cocaine5 and marijuana.6 Recently, environmental factors such as elevated concentrations of ambient particulate matter have been added to the list of triggers.7

    abstract = { Studies showing that current levels of air pollution in the cities of many developed and developing countries are associated with increased rates of mortality and morbidity have heightened concern that air pollution continues to pose a threat to public health.1–3 The evidence suggests that small airborne particles are a toxic component of urban air pollution. Using this interpretation of the evidence as a rationale, the Environmental Protection Agency implemented a new standard for fine particulate matter.4 The existing standard, promulgated in 1987, specified the maximal levels allowable in a 24-hour period and on an annual basis for particulate matter .\&nbsp;.\&nbsp;. }

    abstract = { We used the case-crossover design to identify any increase in mortality in Seoul, Korea, when there were higher levels of ambient air pollution on case-days than would be expected solely as a result of chance. This empirical study showed that either unidirectional retrospective (selecting only control days prior to death) or prospective (selecting only control days after death) control sampling could cause risk estimates to be confounded by seasonal waves as well as time trends in air pollution levels. In bidirectional control sampling in which exposures at death were compared with exposures both before and after death, the estimated mortality was resistant to confounding by time patterns of air pollution. Using a bidirectional control sampling approach, the results from a conditional logistic regression model controlling for weather conditions showed that the nonaccidental mortality associated with a 50-ppb increment over a 3-day moving average of SO(2) concentrations, including the concurrent day and preceding 2 days, was 1.023 [95\% confidence interval (CI), 1.016-1.084]. The relative risk of death was 1.023 (CI, 0.999-1.048) per 50 ppb for 1-hr maximum O(3) and 1.010 (CI, 0.988-1.032) per 100 microg/m(3 )or total suspended particulates. In conclusion, the findings of this study were 2-fold: given the consistency of the observed association between SO(2) and daily mortality across different analysis methods, the association reported here indicates that air pollution is a probable contributor to premature death; and bidirectional control sampling is needed in a case-crossover design applied to air pollution epidemiologic studies to control confounding by seasonal patterns of air pollution as well as time trends. }

    abstract = {Persons with congestive heart failure may be susceptible to ambient air pollution. The authors evaluated the association between exposure to particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter of \&lt;2.5 μm (PM2.5) and onset of symptom exacerbation leading to hospital admission in Baltimore, Maryland. They used a case-crossover design for 135 case events occurring among 125 persons with prevalent congestive heart failure who were admitted to a single hospital through the emergency department during 2002. The case period was assigned using three index times: 8-hour and 24-hour periods of symptom onset and date of hospital admission. Controlling for weather, the authors detected a modest relative increase in risk for cases defined by 8-hour symptom onset for an interquartile-range increase in PM2.5 at a 2-day lag (odds ratio = 1.09, 95\% confidence interval: 0.91, 1.30). A corresponding increase in risk was not observed when admission date was used to define the case period. A series of simulations based on study data indicated that the study had adequate statistical power to detect odds ratios of 1.2 or higher. Although overall findings were not statistically significant, the identification of case events defined by an 8-hour onset period may be more relevant than either a 24-hour onset period or the admission date for estimating harmful effects of air pollutant exposure on cardiovascular health.},

abstract = {Inference from studies that make use of data at the level of the area, rather than at the level of the individual, is more difficult for a variety of reasons. Some of these difficulties arise because frequently exposures (including confounders) vary within areas. In the most basic form of ecological study the outcome measure is regressed against a simple area level summary of exposure. In the aggregate data approach a survey of exposures and confounders is taken within each area. An alternative approach is to assume a parametric form for the within-area exposure distribution. We provide a framework within which ecological and aggregate data studies may be viewed, and we review some approaches to inference in such studies, clarifying the assumptions on which they are based. General strategies for analysis are provided including an estimator based on Monte Carlo integration that allows inference in the case of a general risk–exposure model. We also consider the implications of the introduction of random effects, and the existence of confounding and errors in variables.},

    abstract = { Recently, attention has focused on whether particulate air pollution is a specific trigger of myocardial infarction (MI). The results of several studies of single locations assessing the effects of ambient particular matter on the risk of MI have been disparate. We used a multicity case-crossover study to examine risk of emergency hospitalization associated with fine particulate matter (PM) with aerodynamic diameter \&lt; 10 μm (PM10) for \&gt; 300,000 MIs during 1985–1999 among elderly residents of 21 U.S. cities. We used time-stratified controls matched on day of the week or on temperature to detect possible residual confounding by weather. Overall, we found a 0.65\% [95\% confidence interval (CI), 0.3–1.0\%] increased risk of hospitalization for MI per 10 μg/m3 increase in ambient PM10 concentration. Matching on apparent temperature yielded a 0.64\% increase in risk (95\% CI, 0.1–1.2\%). We found that the effect size for PM10 doubled for subjects with a previous admission for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or a secondary diagnosis of pneumonia, although these differences did not achieve statistical significance. There was a weaker indication of a larger effect on males but no evidence of effect modification by age or the other diagnoses. We also found that the shape of the exposure–response relationship between MI hospitalizations and PM10 is almost linear, but with a steeper slope at levels of PM10 \&lt; 50 μg/m3. We conclude that increased concentrations of ambient PM10 are associated with increased risk of MI among the elderly. }
